# MajorSystemIPhoneApp

The goal of this program is to aid in learning the major memory system.

The major system is a memory aid that can enhance your memory for numbers.

The idea is that words are easier to remember than numbers and by using this system you can convert neutral numbers into vivid images in order to aid your memory.

Let’s say that you want to remember the phone number (752) - 140 - 4160.  Using the major system, you would be able to convert these numbers into a series of words, such as “clown throws red shoes”.
